# BiAxis
## This is a WIP 2D game engine. 
It can be used, but it probably shouldn't be. I'm making slow progress on the editor. 1.0.0 will ship with more modules, a fully functional editor, and actual documentation.
## TODO
### modules
- [x] zon_tool
- [ ] physics
- [ ] raylib_default_run
### editor
- [ ] scrollable containers
- [ ] icons
- [ ] more UI elements
